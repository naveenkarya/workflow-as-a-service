# workflow-as-a-service

SCU COEN 241 (Cloud computing group project)
This repo is replicated from our group's previous repo: https://github.com/ccfernandes/workflow-as-a-service

This is a Platform-as-a-Service application that helps users create (and reuse) workflows using a User interface.
Each activity of a workflow can be defined by its docker image that will be deployed by this framework in a kubernetes cluster.

Below is the high-level architecture. Please see [Final Report](https://github.com/naveenkarya/workflow-as-a-service/blob/main/COEN_241_Final_Report.pdf) for more details.
